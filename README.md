# Spotifollow

This web app allows users to sign in with their Spotify account and "follow" another user's playlist.

A copy of their playlist will be made to your account so you can add or remove songs at your leisure. On the web app, users can update the playlist to match any changes made to the original playlist, while maintaining any of your removals or additions.

## Getting Started

This web app was hosted on an AWS EC-2 instance which has been closed down for the meantime.

The readme will be updated if it is back up.
